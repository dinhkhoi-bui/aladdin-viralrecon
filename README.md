## Introduction

**nf-core/viralrecon** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used to perform assembly and intra-host/low-frequency variant calling for viral samples. The pipeline supports both Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data. For Illumina short-reads the pipeline is able to analyse metagenomics data typically obtained from shotgun sequencing (e.g. directly from clinical samples) and enrichment-based library preparation methods (e.g. amplicon-based: [ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 enrichment protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019); or probe-capture-based). For Nanopore data the pipeline only supports amplicon-based analysis obtained from primer sets created and maintained by the [ARTIC Network](https://artic.network/).

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from running the full-sized tests individually for each `--platform` option can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/results) and the output directories will be named accordingly i.e. `platform_illumina/` and `platform_nanopore/`.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

## Pipeline summary

The pipeline has numerous options to allow you to run only specific aspects of the workflow if you so wish. For example, for Illumina data you can skip the host read filtering step with Kraken 2 with `--skip_kraken2` or you can skip all of the assembly steps with the `--skip_assembly` parameter. See the [usage](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage) and [parameter](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/parameters) docs for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

The SRA download functionality has been removed from the pipeline (`>=2.1`) and ported to an independent workflow called [nf-core/fetchngs](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs). You can provide `--nf_core_pipeline viralrecon` when running nf-core/fetchngs to download and auto-create a samplesheet containing publicly available samples that can be accepted directly by the Illumina processing mode of nf-core/viralrecon.

A number of improvements were made to the pipeline recently, mainly with regard to the variant calling. Please see [Major updates in v2.3](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/issues/271) for a more detailed description.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
> to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
> with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
SAMPLE_1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end). Rows with the same sample identifier are considered technical replicates and merged automatically.

### Typical commands

#### Illumina shotgun analysis

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
   --design samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --platform illumina \
   --protocol metagenomic \
   --genome 'MN908947.3' \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute>
```

#### Illumina amplicon analysis

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
   --design samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --platform illumina \
   --protocol amplicon \

```

#### Nanopore amplicon analysis:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
   --design samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --platform nanopore \
   --genome 'MN908947.3' \
   --primer_set 'artic' \
   --primer_set_version 3 \
   --fastq_dir fastq_pass/ \
   --fast5_dir fast5_pass/ \
   --sequencing_summary sequencing_summary.txt \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute>
```
